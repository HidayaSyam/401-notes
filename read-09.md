MongoDB has the join-like $lookup aggregation operator in versions >= 3.2. Mongoose has a more powerful alternative called populate(), which lets you reference documents in other collections.

Population is the process of automatically replacing the specified paths in the document with document(s) from other collection(s). We may populate a single document, multiple documents, a plain object, multiple plain objects, or all objects returned from a query. Let's look at some examples.

## What is a Subdocument?
Subdocuments are similar to normal documents. Nested schemas can have middleware, custom validation logic, virtuals, and any other feature top-level schemas can use. The major difference is that subdocuments are not saved individually, they are saved whenever their top-level parent document is saved.

### Subdocuments versus Nested Paths
In Mongoose, nested paths are subtly different from subdocuments. For example, below are two schemas: one with child as a subdocument, and one with child as a nested path.


## Router
A router object is an isolated instance of middleware and routes. You can think of it as a “mini-application,” capable only of performing middleware and routing functions. Every Express application has a built-in app router.

A router behaves like middleware itself, so you can use it as an argument to app.use() or as the argument to another router’s use() method.

The top-level express object has a Router() method that creates a new router object.

Once you’ve created a router object, you can add middleware and HTTP method routes (such as get, put, post, and so on) to it just like an application. 

### Methods

- ### router.all(path, [callback, ...] callback)
This method is just like the router.METHOD() methods, except that it matches all HTTP methods (verbs).

This method is extremely useful for mapping “global” logic for specific path prefixes or arbitrary matches. For example, if you placed the following route at the top of all other route definitions, it would require that all routes from that point on would require authentication, and automatically load a user. Keep in mind that these callbacks do not have to act as end points; loadUser can perform a task, then call next() to continue matching subsequent routes.

- ###  router.METHOD(path, [callback, ...] callback)
The router.METHOD() methods provide the routing functionality in Express, where METHOD is one of the HTTP methods, such as GET, PUT, POST, and so on, in lowercase. Thus, the actual methods are router.get(), router.post(), router.put(), and so on.
