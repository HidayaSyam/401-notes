## Graph
- ### A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## We Have To Rype of Graph Depand on Edges

- ### Directed Graphs 
####  is a graph where every edge is directed.
####  Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

- ### Un-Directed Graphs
#### that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional.


- ### Acyclic Graph
#### An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

- ### Cyclic Graphs
####  Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
