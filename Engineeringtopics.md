# Solve Programming Problems
## A simple set of steps
### I am going to give you a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.

- ## Read the problem completely twice.
### This is the single most important step.  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.
- ## Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
### Programming is automation plain and simple.  You may have the ability to skip the manual steps and jump directly to code, but there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.  Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely.
- ## Optimize the manual steps.
### People often don’t realize how valuable this step is.  It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.
- ## Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
### Many times you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution that coding it is already a 1 to 1 translation.

### If you are a beginner or struggle with these kinds of problems, I would go ahead and take the time to do this step anyway though.

### What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

###  By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job of filling in the actual code later trivial.
- ## Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
### This step should be extremely easy at this point.  If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.
- ## Optimize the real code.
### Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.This is also a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.  I cannot stress enough how important having good names for your variables and methods is for helping the person evaluating your code to understand what you were trying to do.  This is especially important when you make a mistake!
